/// extract the chunks from the hashmap
/// calculate the chunks required
/// do that by taking the top left pixel and then taking all the chunks between it and the chunk bounds + 1
/// take the top left pixel and bottom right. convert to chunk coordinates then add an offset. construct the buffer
/// somehow get the coordinates per cell
/// simulate the buffer
/// then write back the buffer back to the hash map
